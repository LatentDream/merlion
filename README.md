Leanring go:
```
I'm building a CLI tool to visualise / edit markdown note. 

I already have a backend, which I can all, to pull the note (http call). 

I want to build the cli tool as a TUI, with Go, Lipgloss, BubbleTea and other lib from charmbracelet. 

Help me with Go, it's my first time writting Go
